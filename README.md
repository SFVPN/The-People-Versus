# The People Versus

Crowdsourced views on the issue of digital / general tech accessibility for people living with dementia, as well as family members and carers.

Good web accessibility practice is far from widespread on the Internet.  But even when a site meets all Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), we are still lacking in guidance and evidence about how website accessibility is affected by cognitive impairments - in particular living with a diagnosis of dementia.  If you add to this the plethora of smart home products now available to 'simplify' our daily routines, then you introduce another area of technology from which people living with dementia may be excluded.

How to do we address this gap in knowledge?  Well the simplest and most effective way is to ask the people themselves. As designers and developers we crave usability feedback to refine our products, so why not use this tried and tested approach.
